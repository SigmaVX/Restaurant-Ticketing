# Chronos - Food Order Ticketing App
Chronos is a full stack single page app for tracking and processing customer food orders.  It is built with an MVC setup, API routes, and a custom ORM that lets users enter orders into an SQL database and mark when the order is complete. It automatically tracks time and alerts users when a table is missing a food item.  The app is built with Node JS, Express, a Handlebars view engine, the DOTENV module to secure data, and Bootstrap 4.
